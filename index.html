        <hr>

        <img class="headshot" src="assets/images/mainPage.jpg" alt="self portrait">
        <p>My name is Jamie O'Neill and I have a doctorate in pharmacy from the University of Georgia.  After working retail for several years I decided to start my own company to be a personal medication advocate for Senior Citizens.  After attempting to tackle the issue for the past 5 years I realized that I was up against a powerful and broken system.  I have decided to become a coder to further my humanitarian ambition in an arena more conduscent to innovation.</p>
        
        <p>I married my best friend in 2012 and we have an adorable Chihuahua named JP.  My favorite things to do are travel, explore theological and philosophical concepts, learn history, listen to music, spend time in nature, enjoy art both as a consumer and creator.</p>
        
        <p>My favorite musicians are Alt J, Glass Animals, Radiohead, Run the Jewels, Ween, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Big Gigantic, Devil Makes Three, Old Crow Medicine Show, Regina Spektor, CSNY, and Widespread Panic.  My favorite TV shows are Rick and Morty, Silicon Valley, Handmaid's Tale, SouthPark, InkMaster, and Adventure Time</p>
